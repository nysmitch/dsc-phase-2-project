### Business Understanding

The business I will be looking at creating a linear regression model for is King Real Estate. They are looking at purchasing some properties in the King's county area and a re looking for some direction and predictions at what the house prices will be depedning on certain features.

## Data Understanding

The dataset I will be using is the Kings County House sales dataset. 

This includes the following information for over 2000 properties:
 - ID
 - price
 - bedrooms
 - bathrooms
 - sqft_living
 - sqft_lot
 - floors
 - waterfront
 - view
 - condition
 - grade
 - sqft_above
 - sqft_basement
 - yr_built
 - yr_renovated
 - zipcode
 - latitutde
 - longitude
 - sqft_living15
 - sqft_lot15

Using this data I will advise King Real estate as to what features will affect the price of a house.

## Data Preparation
In preparation for modeling I have decided to drop some of the data to limit the dataset to what information I will be using. transformed the data to the Dtype i would require for certain models.

## Modeling

To begin the process I created a heatmap to determine a starting point on observing what house characteristics had high correlation with price.

## Deliverables

There are three deliverables for this project:

* A **GitHub repository**
* A **Jupyter Notebook**
* A **non-technical presentation**

Review the "Project Submission & Review" page in the "Milestones Instructions" topic for instructions on creating and submitting your deliverables. Refer to the rubric associated with this assignment for specifications describing high-quality deliverables.

### Key Points

* **Your deliverables should explicitly address each step of the data science process.** Refer to [the Data Science Process lesson](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-data-science-processes) from Topic 19 for more information about process models you can use.

* **Your Jupyter Notebook should demonstrate an iterative approach to modeling.** This means that you begin with a basic model, evaluate it, and then provide justification for and proceed to a new model. After you finish refining your models, you should provide 1-3 paragraphs discussing your final model - this should include interpreting at least 3 important parameter estimates or statistics.

* **Based on the results of your models, your notebook and presentation should discuss at least two features that have strong relationships with housing prices.**

## Getting Started

Start on this project by forking and cloning [this project repository](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-phase-2-project) to get a local copy of the dataset.

We recommend structuring your project repository similar to the structure in [the Phase 1 Project Template](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-project-template). You can do this either by creating a new fork of that repository to work in or by building a new repository from scratch that mimics that structure.

## Project Submission and Review

Review the "Project Submission & Review" page in the "Milestones Instructions" topic to learn how to submit your project and how it will be reviewed. Your project must pass review for you to progress to the next Phase.

## Summary

This project will give you a valuable opportunity to develop your data science skills using real-world data. The end-of-phase projects are a critical part of the program because they give you a chance to bring together all the skills you've learned, apply them to realistic projects for a business stakeholder, practice communication skills, and get feedback to help you improve. You've got this!
